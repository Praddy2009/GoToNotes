<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Waterfall Model</h1><br/><br /><strong>Classical Waterfall Model</strong><br />It divides lifecycle into following phases:<br />      • Feasibility study<br />      • Requirement analysis and specification<br />      • Design<br />      • Coding and unit testing<br />      • Integration and system testing<br />      • Maintenance<br /><br /><img src="images/15-1.png" alt="images/15-1.png" /><br /><br />Relative effort for phases<br />   ⇒ Phases between feasibility study and testing are called development phases.<br />   ⇒ Among all life cycle phases maintenance phase consumes maximum effort.<br />   ⇒ Among development phases, testing phase consumes the maximum effort.<br />      <br />                         <img src="images/15-2.png" alt="images/15-2.png" /><br />                         <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />                         <br /><strong>Feasibility Study</strong><br />    <img src="images/15-3.png" alt="images/15-3.png" /><br />    <br />    Main aim of feasibility study is to determine whether developing the software is:<br />        - Financially Worthwhile<br />        - Technically feasible<br />        <br />    Roughly understand what customer wants<br />        - Data which would be input to the system<br />        - Processing needed on these data<br />        - Output data to be produced by the system<br />        - Various contrains on the behaviour of the system.<br />        <br />     Activities During Feasibility Study<br />        -Workout an overall understanding of the problem.<br />        -Formulate different solution strategies.<br />        -Examine alternate solution strategies in terms of:<br />            -&gt;Resources required<br />            -&gt; Cost of developmet<br />            -&gt; Development time<br />        -Perform a cost/benefit analysis<br />            -&gt;Determine which solution is best<br />            -&gt; May also find none of the solutions is feasible due to high cost, resource contraints, technical reasons.<br />            <br />     In <strong>cost/benefit</strong> analysis <br />        -Need to identify all costs which could include<br />            -&gt; Development costs<br />            -&gt; Set-up<br />            -&gt; Operational costs<br />         -Identify the values of benefits<br />         -Check benefits are greater than costs<br />         <img src="images/15-4.png" alt="images/15-4.png" /><br />         <br />         When the feasibility study overs, it help to write <strong>Business case</strong>.<br />         Business case must<br />            - provide the justification for the starting of the project.<br />            - Should show that the benefits of the project will exceed.<br />            - Need to take account of business risks.<br />         <img src="images/15-5.png" alt="images/15-5.png" /><br />         <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><strong>Requirement Analysis and specifications<br /></strong><br />    -&gt; Aim of this phase:<br />            - Understand the exact requirements of the customer.<br />            - Document them properly.         <br />    <br />    -&gt; Consist of two distinct activities<br />            - Requirement gathering and analysis.<br />            - Requirements specification<br />       <br />     In <strong>Requirement gathering</strong> we gather requirement data from the customer and in <strong>requirement analysis</strong> we analyze the collected data to understand what customers want. <br />     On analysis we can find certain problems in the requirement namely:<br />        - Inconsistencies (one part contradicts other part)<br />        - Anomalies (Some part is not clear)<br />        - Incompleteness (some part is incomplete)<br />        <br />     After removing all these problems a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is formed.<br />     <br /> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><strong>Design</strong><br />    During design phase requirements specfication is transformed into a form suitable for implementation in some programming language.<br />    <br />    Two commonly used design approaches are :<br />        - Traditional approach<br />        - Object oriented approach<br /><br />    In traditional approach, two things are done<br />        - Structured analysis (typically carried out by Data flow design (DFD))<br />        - Structured design<br />            <img src="images/15-6.png" alt="images/15-6.png" /><br />            <br />     In object oriented design(OOD), we first identify various objects(real world entities) occuring in the problem then identify the relationship among the objects. <br />        Then we create object structure by refining it to obtain detailed design.<br />     <br />    <strong> Advantages of OOD   </strong><br />        -Lower development effort<br />        -Lower development time<br />        -Better maintainability<br />        <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><strong>Coding and Unit testing</strong><br />    During this phase :<br />        - Each module of the design is coded<br />        - Each module is unit tested i.e tested independently as a standalone unit and debugged.<br />        - Each module is documented.<br />        <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><strong>Integration and System Testing</strong><br /><br />    During Integration:<br />    - Different modules are integrated in a planned manner. <br />    - The modules are usually integrated through a number of steps.<br />    - During each integration step, the partially integrated system is tested.<br />    <br />    During system testing:<br />    -It's done after all the integration of module is finished.<br />    -It's goal is to ensure that the developed system functions according to its requirements as specified in the SRS document.  <br />    <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><strong>Maintenance</strong><br />    - Maintenance of any software requires much more efforts that the effort to develop the product itself.<br />    - Development effort to maintennce effort is typically 40:60.<br />        <br />    <strong>Types of maintenance</strong><br />         <br />         <img src="images/15-7.png" alt="images/15-7.png" />   <br />         <br />Classical waterfall model is idealistic:<br />    - It assumens that no defects is introduced during any development activity but in practice defects do get introduced in almost every phase of the life cycle.<br />    <br />    - Defects usually get detected much later in the life cycle. For ex, a design defect might go unnoticed till the coding or testing phase.<br />    <br />    - The later the phase in which the defect gets detected, the more expensive is its removal.<br />    <br />    - Once a defect is detected:<br />        -&gt; The phase in which it occured needs to be reworked.<br />        -&gt; Redo some of the work done during that and all subsequent phases.<br />        <br />    - So we came up with a solution that : <br />    <strong>“</strong>There is need of feedback paths in the classical waterfall model.<strong>”</strong>    and we called this updated model as <strong>Iterative waterfall model</strong>.<br />     <img src="images/15-8.png" alt="images/15-8.png" /><br />     <br />  From above observations we concluded that <strong>“Errors should be detected in the same phase in which they are introduced”</strong> and this is called phase containment of errors.  <br />     <br />     <strong>Strengths of waterfall model</strong><br />      → Easy to understand, easy to use<br />      → Provides a reference to inexperienced staff<br />      → Milestones are well understood by the team<br />      → Provides requirement stability<br />      → Facilitates strong management control (plan, staff, track)<br />    <br />     <strong>Deficienies of waterfall model</strong><br />      → All requirements must be known upfront<br />      → Deliverables created for each phase are considered frozen-inhibits flexibility<br />      → Can give a false impression of progress.<br />      → Integration is one big bang at the end.<br />      → Little opportunity for customers to preview the system.<br />      <br />      <img src="images/15-9.png" alt="images/15-9.png" /><br />      <br />      <br /><strong>    When to use Waterfall model?</strong><br />     → Requirements are well known and stable<br />     → Technology is understood<br />     → Experienced development team           <br />             <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>

<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Evolutionary Model</h1><br/><br />- First develop the core modules of the software.<br />- The initial skeletal software is refined into increasing levels of capabillity(iterations) <br />- In each iteration, adding new functionalities in successive versions. <br />- These iterations are called mini waterfall hence software developed over several “Mini waterfalls”<br /><br />- The result of a single iteration:<br />   → Ends with delivery of some tangible code<br />   → An incremental improvement to the software -- leads to evolutionary development.<br /><br /><br />- Outcome of each iteration is that some code is tested and then integrated into execultable system.<br /><br />- Iteration lenght is short and fixed generally 2 and 6 weeks.<br />- Development takes many iterations(for ex : 10-15)<br /> <br />- Requirements are allowed to change as well as the design. <br /><br />→ <strong>Successive versions</strong><br />   ⇒ Functioning systems capable of performing some useful work.<br />   ⇒ A new release may include new functionalitiy:<br />      • Also existing functionality in the current release might have been enhanced.<br />    <br /><img src="images/17-1.png" alt="images/17-1.png" /><br /><br /><strong>    Advantages</strong><br />        - User get a chance to experiment with partially developed system much before the full working version is released which helps in finding exact user requirements.<br />        - Core modules get tested thoroughly which reduces chances of errors in final delivered software<br />        - Better management of comlexity by developing one increment at a time.<br />        - Better management of changing requirements.<br />        - Can get customer feedback and incorporate them much more efficiently.  <br />        - Frequent releases allows developers to fix unanticipated problems quicker.<br />        <br />    <strong>Disadvantages</strong><br />        -  The process is intangible as no regular or well defined deliverables.<br />        - The process is unpredictable<br />        - Systems are rather poorly structured  <br />        - Systems may not even converge to a final version.     <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        <br />        </div></body></html>

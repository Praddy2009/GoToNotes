<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Exploratory Style</h1><br/><br /><strong>Que </strong>: What is exploratory software Development?<br /><strong>Ans</strong>  : Early programmers used exploratory (also called build and fix) style.<br />            - A ‘dirty’ program is quickly developed.<br />            - The bugs are fixed as and when they are noticed.<br />            - Similar to how a junior develops programs...<br />            <br />            <img src="images/3-1.png" alt="images/3-1.png" /><br />            <br /><strong>Que</strong> : What is wrong with the exploratory Style?<br /><strong>Ans</strong>  : Can successfully be used for developing only very small(toy) programs but if we increase the program size then effort cost and time increases exponentially. This method even breaks/fails after certain size.<br /><br /><img src="images/3-2.png" alt="images/3-2.png" /><br /><br />        Beside the exponential growth of effort,cost and time with proble size:<br />        - Exploratory style usually results in unmaintainable code.<br />        - It becomes very difficult to use the exploratory style in team development environments.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Software engineering principles extensively use techniques specifically targeted to overcome the human cognitive limitations.<br /><br />Two important principles are<br /><br />    - <strong>Abstraction</strong> Focus attention on only one aspect of the problem and ignore other aspects and irrelevant details. Also called model building.<br />    Simplifying a problem by omitting unnecessary details.<br />    For complex problems:<br />        - A single level of abstraction is inadequate.<br />        - A hierarchy of abstractions may have to be constructed.<br />        <br />                              <img src="images/3-3.png" alt="images/3-3.png" /><br />        <br />    - <strong>Decomposition</strong> : <br />        It decomposes a problem into many small independent parts.<br />        The small parts are then taken up one by one and solved separately.<br />        The idea is that each small part would be easy to grasp and therefore can be easily solved.<br />        The full problem is solved when all the parts are solved.<br />        The decomposed parts must be more or less independent of each other.<br />        <br />        Ex: The capters of book.<br />    <br />    </div></body></html>

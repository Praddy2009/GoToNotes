<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Evolution of SE Techniques</h1><br/>⇒ <strong>Early computer Programming(50s)</strong><br />      • Every programmer developed his/her own style of writing programs:<br />         ◇ According to his intution (called exploratory or build-and-fix programming)<br />           <br />⇒ <strong>High Level Language Programming (Early 60s)</strong><br />      • High level languages such as FORTRAN, ALGOL, and COBOL were introduced:<br />         ◇ This reduced software development efforts greatly.<br /> <br /> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />        <br />      • Software development style was still exploratory.<br />         ◇ Typical program sizes were limited to a few thousands of line of source code.<br /><br />      • Size and complexity of programs increased further:<br />         ◇ Exploratory programming style proved to be insufficient.<br />         <br />      • Programmers found:<br />         ◇ Very difficult to write cost effective and correct programs.<br />         <br />      • Programmers found it very difficult:<br />         ◇ To understand and maintain programs written by others.<br /> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />    <br />⇒ <strong>Control flow based Design (late 60s)</strong><br />   <br />      • What is a program's control structure?<br />         ◇ The sequence in which the program's instructions are executed.<br />                            <img src="images/10-1.png" alt="images/10-1.png" /><br />                                     <br />      • To help design programs having good control structure:<br />         ◇ Flow charting technique was developed<br />         <br />      • Using flow charting technique:        <br />         ◇ One can represent and design a program's control structure.<br />         ◇ When asked to understand a program:<br />            ▪ One would mentally trace the program's execution sequence.  <br />            <br />      • A program having a messy flow chart representation:<br />         ◇ Difficult to understand and debug.<br />         <img src="images/10-2.png" alt="images/10-2.png" /><br />         <br />These control flow designes started to become more complex due to usage of JUMP statements and this gave us new method of Structured programming.<br /><br />⇒ <strong>Structured Programming</strong><br />    When Dijkastra said that using GOTO statements makes the program very complex and sofesticated then many counter articles were written against this announcement.<br />    <br />    It was soon conclusively proved that only three programming constructs are sufficient to express any programming logic.<br />    <br />    A program is called structured: <br />    -&gt;When it uses only the following types of contructs:<br />        - <strong>Sequence</strong> (statement seq)<br />        - <strong>Selection</strong> (if else, switch)<br />        - <strong>Iteration</strong> (loops)<br />        <br />     -&gt;Consist of modules<br />     <br /><strong>Advantages of structured programming</strong><br />    -&gt;They are:<br />        - Easy to read and understand<br />        - Easier to maintain<br />        - Require less effort and time for development<br />        - Less buggy<br />        <br />⇒ <strong>Data Structure-Oriented Design(Early 70s) </strong><br />   • As program sizes increased further, soon it was discovered:<br />      ◇ It's important to pay more attention to the design of data structures of a program than to the design of its control structure.<br />      <br />   • Techniques which emphasize designing the data structure and derive the program structure from it are called data structure oriented design techniques.         <br /><br />⇒ <strong>Data flow Oriented Design (Late 70s) </strong><br />   • Data flow-oriented techniques advocate:<br />      ◇ The data item input to a system must first be identified.<br />      ◇ Processing required on the data to produce the required outputs should be determined.<br />      <br />   • Data flow technique identifies:<br />      ◇ Different processing stations(functions) in a system.<br />      ◇ The items (data) that flow between processing stations.<br />    <br />    <img src="images/10-3.png" alt="images/10-3.png" /><br />    <br />⇒ <strong>Object Oriented Design (80s)</strong><br />   • Object oriented technique<br />      ◇ An intuitively appealing design approach<br />      ◇ Use of natural objects (such as employees, pay-roll-register,etc.) occuring in a problem are first identified.<br />      ◇ Relationships among objects(such as composition, reference, and inheritance) are determined <br />      ◇ Each object essentially acts as a data hiding(or data abstraction) entity.<br /><br /><strong>Advantages</strong><br />    - Simplicity<br />    - Increased Reuse possibility<br />    - Lower development time and cost<br />    - More robust code<br />    - Easy maintenance<br />    <br />    <br />    <br />    <br /><img src="images/10-4.png" alt="images/10-4.png" /></div></body></html>

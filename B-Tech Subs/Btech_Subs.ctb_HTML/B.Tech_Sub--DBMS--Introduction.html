With two-tier client/server architectures, the user system interface is usually located in the user's dektop environment and the database mangement services are usually in a server that is a more powerful machine that services many clients.<br /><br /><strong>For Ex:</strong> When we visit bank then employess are connected directly to local database. Or when we book train tickets from station.<br /><br /><br /><strong>3 Tier Architecture</strong><br /><br />                <img src="images/28-4.png" alt="images/28-4.png" /><br />                <br />In three-tier, the application logic or process lives in the middle-tier, it is separated from the data and the user interface. Three-tier systems are more scalable, robust and flexible. In addition, they can integrate data from multiple sources. In the three-tier architecture, a middle tier was added between the user system interface client environment and the database management server environment.<br /><br />For Ex: The apps and websites we use nowadays are based on this architecture<br /><br />            <img src="images/28-5.png" alt="images/28-5.png" /><br />            <br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br /><strong>Que:</strong> What is schema?<br /><strong>Ans:</strong> Schema is the logical representation of the database. For  Ex: In RDBMS data is logically represented in form of table.<br /><br /><strong>Three Level of Abstraction</strong> / <strong>Three Schema Architecture</strong><br />        <br />        <img src="images/28-6.png" alt="images/28-6.png" /><br />        <br />This framework is used to describe the structure of a specific database system. The three schema architecture is also used to separate the user applications and physical database. <br /><br /><strong>        &gt; Internal/Physical Level</strong><br />            • The internal level has an internal schema which describes the physical storage structure of the database.<br />            • The internal schema is also known as a physical schema.<br />            • It uses the physical data model. It is used to define that how the data will be stored in a block.<br />            • The physical level is used to describe complex low-level data structures in detail.<br />    <br /><strong>        &gt; Conceptual Level</strong><br />            • The conceptual schema describes the design of a database at the conceptual level. Conceptual level is also known as logical level.<br />            • The conceptual schema describes the structure of the whole database.<br />            • The conceptual level describes what data are to be stored in the database and also describes what relationship exist among these data.<br />            • In the conceptual level, internal details such as an implementation of the data structure are hidden.<br />            • Programmers and database admin work at this level.<br />    <br /><strong>        &gt; External Level</strong>     <br />            • At the external level, a database contains several schemas that sometimes called as subschema. The subschema is used to describe the different view of the database.<br />            • An external schema is also known as view schema.<br />            • Each view schema describes the database part that a particular user group is interested and hides the remaining database from that user group.<br />            • The view schema describes the end user interaction with database system.<br /><br />In above diagram we saw the framework used for database. On of the biggest advatage of this framework is data independence.<br /><br /><strong>Data Independence / Data Abstraction</strong><br />    <br />    Data Independence is defined as a property of DBMS that helps you to change the Database schema at one level of a database system without requiring to change the schema at the next higher level.<br />    <br /><strong>    Type of Data Independence</strong><br />    <br />      <strong>1.   Physical Data Independence</strong><br />                Physical data independence helps you to separate conceptual levels from the internal/physical levels. It allows you to provide a logical description of the database without the need to specify physical structures.<br />                <br />                With Physical independence, you can easily change the physical storage or device with no effect on the conceptual schema. Any change done would be absorbed by the <strong>mapping</strong> between the conceptual and internal levels.<br />                <br />                <img src="images/28-7.png" alt="images/28-7.png" /><br />                <br />      <strong>2.   Logical Data Independence</strong><br />                Logical data independence is the ability to change the conceptual schema without changing external views and external API or program. <br />                <br />                Any changes made will be absorbed by the mapping between external and conceptual levels.<br />                <br />                <img src="images/28-8.png" alt="images/28-8.png" /></div></body></html>

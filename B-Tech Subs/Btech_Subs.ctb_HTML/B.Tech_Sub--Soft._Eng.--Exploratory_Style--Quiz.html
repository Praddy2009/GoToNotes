Serveral types of model could be there for a problem. If it's a complex model then we create a hierarchy of models. <br /><br /><strong>Que</strong>: Why develop a model?That is,how does constructing a model help?<br /><strong>Ans</strong>: Understanding a complex problem is difficult due to human cognitive limitations. So to overcome this we would like to understand first the simplest form of the problem that is at the top of the hierarchy and then focus on other models to develop an incremental understanding of the model.<br /><br /><strong>Que</strong>: Give some Examples of models. <br /><strong>Ans</strong>: Content page of book, Simulation model etc.<br /><br /><strong>Que</strong>: Why study software engineering?<br /><strong>Ans</strong>: To acquire skills to develop large programs:<br />            -Handling exponential growth i9n complexity with size.<br />            -Systematic techniques based on abstraction(modelling) and decomposition.<br />            <br />         To learn systematic techniques of:<br />            -Specification, design, user, interface development, testing, project management, maintenance, etc.<br />            -Appreciate issues that arise in team development.<br />            <br />          To acquire skills to be a better programmer:<br />            -Higher Productivity<br />            -Better Quality Programs  <br />            <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div></body></html>

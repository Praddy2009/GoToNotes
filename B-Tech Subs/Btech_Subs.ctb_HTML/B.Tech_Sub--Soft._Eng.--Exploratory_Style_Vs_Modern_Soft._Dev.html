<body><div class="page"><h1 class="title">Exploratory Style Vs Modern Soft. Dev</h1><br/>→ Use of Life Cycle Models.<br />   ⇒ Now every program is developed according to the adopted life cycle model and follows the stages as mentioned in accepted/adopted life cycle model.<br />   <br />→ Software is developed through several well defined stages:<br />   ⇒ Requirements analysis and specification<br />   ⇒ Design<br />   ⇒ Coding<br />   ⇒ Testing, etc.<br />   <br />→ Emphasis has shifted from error correction to error prevention.<br />   ⇒ Modern practices emphasize detection of error as close to their point of introduction as possible.<br />   ⇒ Focus is on detecting as many errors as possible in each   phase of development.<br /><br />→ In exploratory style:<br />   ⇒ Coding is synonymous with program development<br />→ Now:<br />   ⇒ Coding is considered only a small part of a program development effort. <br /><br />→ A lot of effort and attention is now being paid to Requirements specification.<br /><br />→ Also, now there is a distinct design phase.<br /><br />→ During all stages of development process periodic reviews are being carried out.<br /><br />→ Software testing has become systematic.Standart testing techniques are available.<br /><br />→ There is better visibility of design and code:<br />   ⇒ Visibility means production of good quality, consistent and standard document.<br />   ⇒ In the past, very little attention was being given to producing good quality and consistent documents.<br />   ⇒ We will see later that increased visibility makes software project management easier. <br /><br />→ Because of good documentation:<br />   ⇒ Fault diagnosis and maintenance are smoother now.<br /><br />→ Several metrices are being used which help in software project management, quality assurance, etc.<br /><br />→ Projects are being properly planned with proper estimation, scheduling and monitoring mechanisms.<br /><br />→ Use of CASE tools. </div></body></html>
